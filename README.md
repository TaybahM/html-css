# Introduction

HTML is the standard markup language for creating simple to complex Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used to the descrip the structure of a page. Any website consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display content on their page.&#x20;

"Elements" or "tags" are used to label pieces of content. For example the `<p>` tag is used to organize text content into paragraph elements and the `<img>` tag is used to embed images into a page.&#x20;

Majority of the tags have an opening tag and a closing tag to wrap around content. closing tabs are denoted with a backslash like this: `</tag_name>`. HTML tags are not visible in the browser. The following diagram illustrates how tags are used in HTML elements:&#x20;
